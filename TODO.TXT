----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do:

General:

    - Finish to replace PILL by LUA.
	- Complete the dialog editor.
	- Add a way to replace the default functions of childs windows (load/save, etc)
	  (Probably with a table of pointers).
	- Re-enable the macros recorder.
    - Convert the chromaticsup.dll to C.
    - Convert all .ini to .xml (using the tinyxml library).
    - Handle files sharing violations.

Languages:

    - Give the user a choice in case of several SingleComment entries.
    - The possibility to add a new language from the interface.

Debugger:

	A:

	- Retrieve the user defined breakpoints
	  (from all opened files and modules in debugged project)
	  (files and line numbers passed to dbghelp).
	- Add the disassembler.
	- Add a tooltip to view the current value of the keyword under mouse pointer.

	B:

	- Add a memory viewer in the debugger.
	- Create different types of breakpoints (like start/end timer for profiling purposes
	  and datas watches (VC like)).
	- Add a processes / threads datas viewer.

Templates:

	- Add Virtual Dub filter project (Asm/C).
	- Add 3DSMax plugins projects (C/Asm ?).
	- Add VST plugins projects (C/Asm ?).
	- Add NT driver project template in C/C++.
	- Add decent directx templates.
	- Add complete support for intel Cpp compiler (and ms one).
	- Add one or several wizard(s).
	- Add templates for FreePascal.

Menus:

	- Add MingW32 usermenus.
	- Add FreePascal usermenus.
    - Modify the system to use 4 bytes keys instead of indexes
      (with a keys sanity checkup system).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dialog editor:

- Handle properties of the various controls (add interactivity).
- Handle multiple selection of the controls.
- Handle alignments functions.
- Handle  file loading/saving of dialogs.
- Add the test engine.
- Add dialog to resources export.
  To be considered: An extra option to use scripts here in order to add the ability
  to produce code according to the dialog resources.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What might be done (or not):

Editor:

- Add separations lines in sourcecodes.
- Improve C language handling (especially fncs selections).
- Generator of html documentation for procedures
  (possibly with registers backtracing for assembly).
- Keyboard shortcuts editor.
- Create a bookmarks browser.
- Add a sort function for selected blocks of text.
- Text zooming (based on selected font).
- Add customization abilities for the statusbar (not very important).
- Include a hex editor mode for windows childs (Maybe an AddIn)
  (it could be interesting to be able to paste unknown data from clipboard in
  hex form directly into these windows for further editing).

Coding help:

- Handle include commands by listing INCLUDEDIR/LIBDIR/#INCLUDE/ETC. files in a listbox
  (belongs to code completion).
- Include windows structures in code completion.
- Include user's procedures/variables in code completion.
- Editor for the databases (or use them directly as text)
- Use SQLLITE for the databases.
- Create a better auto-correction engine (not just case correction).

Projects:

- Add project metrics (procedures/variables loads/redundancies/orphans entities).
- Hierarchic organigram of procedures (inter-connexions in diagrams form).
- Create a full project explorer.
- A tasks scheduler for projects (with auto-reminder and so on... a la gantt).
- Add a svn/cvs manager.
- Create a MDI project type (never had the time to include this).
- Add the ability to create new sub folders.
- Projects templates editor (just add the ability to save a project as a template
  existing or new depending on the user choice (combobox)).
- Attach the directories to the skins for easier selections.
- Add templates for pocket pc projects.
- Add the ability to allow the selection of the compilation & assembling tool/file
  (probably the ability to use 1 skin/file).
- Ability to create sub-directories in projects structures.

Misc:

- Add a context menu in toolbars.
- Allow user to modify main context menu.
- Languages editor.
- Skins editor.
- Include an expression to ASM converter/creator (probably an Addin).
- Include a diff utility (probably an Addin).
- Include a PEButcher based on PE handling routines provided to AddIns.
- Convert bmp/ico/cur viewer into a complete paint program.
- Descent Snippets/Templates managers.
- Write the tons of required documentations.
- Change the look of the properties (treeview/vertical).
- Allow the user to change the font of the dialogs and lists
  or use the current system font.

Debugger:

- Add a builtin packets sniffer (w2000++) to help in debugging of network applications.
- Complete the disassembler (SSE2/3).
- Create a monkey mode
  (bomb a debugged application with random windows messages to check it's robustness).
  (+ a system to record/replay messages sequencies).
- Hook API calls in debugged applications (with ability to report memory leaks).
- Add a physical memory dumper.
- Add scripting abilities to debugger (or some plugins possibilities).
- Add separations lines in disassembled code (after ret/jmp/iret).
