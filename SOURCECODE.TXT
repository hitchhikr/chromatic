Take note:

You need MASM32 and Visual C++ (6 or a more recent version but you'll have to convert the project
and i don't guarantee the result) in order to create a new executable.

BuildRC.bat need to be used if any resource is modified.
ChromaticSupp.dll can be asembled within Chromatic itself (via MASM32).
Creating the Addins and Filters require Chromatic as well.

You may need some extra system headers but i don't remember which ones (maybe dbghelp.h & dbghelp.lib)
Probably from the platform SDK.

Innosetup is used with the provided InstallScript.iss file.

The release directory contains stock clean .ini files used during the creation of the installation package.
